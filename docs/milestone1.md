## Introduction


Automatic differentiation, also known as algorithmic differentiation, involves efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions from a computational perspective. In an era of rapidly advancing technology, automatic differentiation has many broad applications, especially in artificial intelligence, allowing many computations to be performed efficiently, greatly expanding the scope and coverage of artificial intelligence to widely different applications to enhance human lives. While artificial intelligence is certainly a widely known application of automatic differentiation with immense potential for further expanded applications, the significance of automatic differentiation also derives from its potential applications in computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design and optimization.

Root finding is an algorithm used to find the zeroes or roots of a continuous function.  Often, solving for the roots of a function analytically is not possible (except in simple cases such as lower degree polynomials).  Iterative methods are used instead.  One highly efficient method is Newtonâ€™s method which requires exact forms or approximations of the derivative of the function.

This software package provides two libraries:
1. Autodiff provides an easy-to-use library that performs automatic differentiation of a user supplied function.

2.Rootfinder uses autodiff to find the roots for continuous functions.
